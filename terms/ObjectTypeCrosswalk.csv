Core ,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/core/""/>",Core,long cylindrical cores,"Have you talked to any of the people involved with the USGS core libraries? They may have suggestions of how they label their materials. Personally, when I used the one in Nevada, I think they only had core, cuttings, grab. They did have another category for wax sealed core that preserves the water inside the core.","I would think that core and core section would be enough in terms of core categories for ESS samples. To me it is more important to know if the core was collected with hand augur, push-coring, rotasonic drill etc as that has implications for the sample integrity etc",

NA,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/coreSub-Piece/""/>",Core Sub-Piece ,unambiguously mated portion of a larger piece noted for curatorial management of the material.,,,
NA,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/coreWholeRound/""/>",Core Whole Round,cylindrical segments of core or core section material.,,,
NA,,,,CTD ,"a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth) cast sample.",CTD may be too specific…maybe something like a wireline sensor is more appropriate. There are many sensors that are essentially tied to a wire and dropped into a water body or well to capture depth-discrete data.,agree that CTD is too narrow,Agree with other comments
Cuttings ,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/cuttings/""/>",Cuttings ,"loose, coarse, unconsolidated material suspended in drilling fluid.",,fine,
Dredge  ,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/dredge/""/>",Dredge  ,a group of rocks collected by dragging a dredge along the seafloor.,,fine,
Experimental Specimen,,,,Experimental Specimen,a synthetic or natural material used during an experiment,"I am not sure about experimental specimen and the fact that it should be “synthetic”. Many people use pure mineral phases (or mixtures) for experiments but they are not necessarily synthetic. For example, there are thousands of papers on the behavior of SWy-1 montmorillonite. However, it is not synthetic; it is a natural material that has been preserved by the clay minerals society and is available for purchase as a standard montmorillonite material. …so I would say synthetic or natural…","experimental specimen is fine, but agree that many experimental specimens are derived from natural materials (most of mine are), which makes them to some extent neither natural nor synthetic",Agree with other comments.
Grab ,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/grab/""/>",Grab ,"a sample (sometimes mechanically collected) from a deposit or area, not intended to be representative of the deposit or area.",,,
NA,,,NA,Hole ,hole cavity and walls surrounding that cavity.,,"I guess this is intended to be used for in-situ characterization (such as soil profiles), but ""hole"" is a bit strange to think of as the obect itself...",Agree with Kristin. A hole seems like the absence of something and therefore not the object
Material Sample,Material Sample,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/MaterialSample,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/individualSample/""/>",Individual Sample ,"a sample that is an individual unit, including rock hand samples, a biological specimen, or a bottle of fluid.",,not sure how this is separate from grab,Any sample type could fall in this category
Filtrate,,,NA,NA,"sample that has gone through a filtration process to separate solids from fluids (liquids or gases), using a filter medium through which only the fluid can pass. Must be associated with a filter size. ","w.r.t to filtrate, you should have a clause like “ Must be associated with filter size field.” Just as the material captured on filter. This is critical because standard filter pore sizes have changed significantly over the years. We used to all think 0.45micron was the standard; now people use all kinds of filter pore sizes and the impact to the filtrate can be huge.",agree that this should be associated with a filter size field (as for the material captured in filter category),Agree with other comments
Material Captured in Filter,,,NA,NA,"a material sample captured in filter, for example from a water sample that was filtered. Must be associated with filter size field. Material options include: ""particulate matter"" or ""particulate matter: organic particulate matter"" .",,fine,
Organism,Organism,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Organism,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/medium/organism""/>",NA,A specimen of a biological organism. ,,isn't this a material rather type of sample (i would think this goes under either individual sample or grab)? Trying to understand how to apply this to for example a leaf sample that you could also specify as a grab sample and this can generate confusion and put the same kinds of samples in different categories depending on how the sample collector interprets or chooses to tag the data,
Part of organism,,,,,"A specimen of a portion of a biological organism (e.g. leaf, root, stem)",,,
Collection of organisms,Collection of Organisms,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PCO_0000000,,,"A material entity that consists of two or more organisms, viruses, or viroids.",,,
NA,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/orientedCore/""/>",Oriented Core ,core that can be positioned on the surface in the same way that it was arranged in the borehole before extraction.,,not sure this is needed as a separate category,Agree with kristin
Other ,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/other/""/>",Other ,a sample that does not fit any of the existing type designations. It is expected that further detailed description of the particular sample will be provided.,,,
NA,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/rockPowder/""/>",Rock Powder ,a sample created from pulverizing a rock to powder.,,this seems like a material and not an object type,
NA,,,"<xs:enumeration value=""http://vocabulary.odm2.org/specimentype/terrestrialSection/""/>",Terrestrial Section ,"a sample of a section of the near-surface Earth, generally in the critical zone.","a lot of work on soils and/or sediments, but, no category for that? If I do a soil excavation and collect from a soil horizon, what name would I use? Maybe grab? Or maybe terrestrial section? Not sure.","hmm, agree this is not clear. To add to the previous comment: a soil core could be classified as a terrestrial section or a core/core section. ","Building on the other comments, if the earlier core sections are for rock cores, that should be explicit."
