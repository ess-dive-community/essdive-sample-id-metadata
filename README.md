# ESS-DIVE Sample ID and Metadata Standard

ESS-DIVE recommends registering samples for [International Geo/General Sample Numbers (IGSNs)](https://www.geosamples.org/aboutigsn) through the [System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR)](https://www.geosamples.org/). IGSNs are associated with standardized metadata to characterize a variety of different samples and their collection details. These sample identifiers facilitate sample discovery, tracking, and reuse; they are especially useful when sample data is shared with collaborators, sent to different labs or user facilities for analyses, or distributed in different data files, datasets, and/or publications. 

ESS-DIVE has worked with community scientists to test use of IGSNs and associated metadata in interdisciplinary Environmental Systems Science. We therefore have specific recommendations for extending IGSN metadata for this interdisciplinary community.

## Getting started

[ESS-DIVE's IGSN metadata quick reference guide](guide.md): IGSN sample metadata guide, modified ([from the SESAR IGSN guide](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3874923)) for interdiscipinary Environmental System Science (ESS) samples. 

Documents to get started and contribute:
- [Instructions document](instructions.md): Instructions to register samples for IGSNs through SESAR, and submit related datasets to ESS-DIVE. 
- [Sample metadata template](sampleTemplate.xls): Download spreadsheet template with standard fields to register samples for IGSNs. 
- [How to contribute](#contribute.md): A guide on how to contribute to ESS-DIVE's sample metadata reporting format.

## About the Sample ID and metadata reporting format

[Metadata research documents](/terms): Files with descriptions of metadata fields and controlled vocabulary terms. Metadata fields with controlled vocabularies are described in the quick reference guide. 

- [Sample metadata translation table](/terms/crosswalk.md): Comparison of basic sample metadata elements across standards and templates to describe physical samples and specimens. 
- [Object type vocabulary](/terms/objectType.md): Description of terms for ESS-DIVE IGSN sample object types. 
  * [Object type comparison](/terms/ObjectTypeCrosswalk.tsv): Comparison of object type terms.
- [Material vocabulary](/terms/material.md): Description of terms for ESS-DIVE IGSN sample object types. 
  * [Material comparison](/terms/MaterialCrosswalk.tsv): Comparison of material terms.

## How to contribute

The purpose of this standard is to support ESS scientists in sample data management, discovery, and reuse. The standard should be useful and practical for this community. We therefore solicit feedback on suggested improvements and any aspect of the standard that does not work well for you.

You can contribute by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/ess-dive-community/essdive-community-repo-guide#how-to-contribute) directly in this github repository (preferred method), or by contacting us at ess-dive-support@lbl.gov.
