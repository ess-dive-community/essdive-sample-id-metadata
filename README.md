# ESS-DIVE Sample ID and Metadata Standard

ESS-DIVE recommends registering samples for persistent identifiers, specifically [International Geo/General Sample Numbers (IGSNs)](https://www.geosamples.org/aboutigsn), which are associated with standardized metadata to characterize samples and their collection details. IGSNs facilitate sample discovery, tracking, and reuse; they are especially useful when sample data is shared with collaborators, sent to different labs or user facilities for analyses, or distributed in different data files, datasets, and/or publications. 

## Getting started

ESS-DIVE has worked with community scientists to test use of IGSNs and associated metadata in interdisciplinary Environmental Systems Science. We therefore have specific recommendations for extending IGSN metadata for this interdisciplinary community, which are incorporated in the following documents:

- Crosswalk comparing sample-related standards and templates
- [Downloadable template for sample metadata](sampleTemplate.xls)
- [Instructions for registering samples for IGSNs through SESAR](instructions.md)
- [Guide to describe sample metadaata elements and associated requirements](guide.md)
- Proposed vocabularies for [object type](objectType.md), [material](material.md), and [units](units.md)
