# ESS-DIVE Sample ID and Metadata Reporting

ESS-DIVE recommends registering samples for [International Geo/General Sample Numbers (IGSNs)](https://www.geosamples.org/aboutigsn) through the [System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR)](https://www.geosamples.org/). IGSNs are associated with standardized metadata to characterize a variety of different samples and their collection details. These sample identifiers facilitate sample discovery, tracking, and reuse; they are especially useful when sample data is shared with collaborators, sent to different labs or user facilities for analyses, or distributed in different data files, datasets, and/or publications. 

ESS-DIVE has worked with our community scientists to test use of IGSNs and associated metadata in interdisciplinary Environmental Systems Science (ESS). Here we outline modified IGSN metadata guidelines to account for needs of a variety of related geological and biological samples. While generally following the IGSN core descriptive metadata schema, we provide recommendations for extending sample type terms, and connecting to related templates geared towards biodiversity (Darwin Core) and genomic (Minimum Information about any Sequence, MIxS) samples and specimens. 

## Getting started

[ESS-DIVE's IGSN metadata reference guide](guide.md): <br>IGSN sample metadata guide, modified ([from the SESAR IGSN guide](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3874923)) for interdiscipinary Environmental System Science (ESS) samples. 

Documents to get started:
- [Instructions document](instructions.md): Instructions to register samples for IGSNs through SESAR, and submit related datasets to ESS-DIVE. 
- [Sample metadata template](sampleTemplate.xls): Download spreadsheet template with standard fields to register samples for IGSNs. 


## How to Contribute: 

ESS-DIVE is a community-focused data repository. Our sample reporting format must fit the needs of ESS data contributors and users, and we need your feedback. See our [guide on how to contribute](contribute.md) to ESS-DIVE's sample metadata reporting format.

## About the Sample ID and metadata reporting format

The ESS-DIVE sample ID and metadata reporting format primarily follows the SESAR IGSN guide and template, with modifications to address ESS sample needs and practicalities. To develop recommendations for ESS, we conducted research on related sample standards and templates in addition to work with project scientists to test use of IGSN and standard metadata. Stay tuned for a link to our related paper describing the recommended sample ID and metadata reporting format. 

Below we outline supporting documents used to compare related metadata and vocabulary terms.  

[Metadata research documents](/terms): Files with descriptions of metadata fields and controlled vocabulary terms. Metadata fields with controlled vocabularies are described in the quick reference guide. 

- [Sample metadata translation table](/terms/sampleMetadataCrosswalk.csv): Comparison of basic sample metadata elements across standards and templates to describe physical samples and specimens. 
- [Sample metadata sources](/terms/sampleMetadataSources.md): List of sources for standard or template in translation table, with scope and available citation. 
- [Object type vocabulary](/terms/objectType.md): Description of terms for ESS-DIVE IGSN sample object types. 
  * [Object type comparison](/terms/ObjectTypeCrosswalk.tsv): Comparison of object type terms.
- [Material vocabulary](/terms/material.md): Description of terms for ESS-DIVE IGSN sample object types. 
  * [Material comparison](/terms/MaterialCrosswalk.tsv): Comparison of material terms. 
- [Units vocabulary](/terms/units.md): Subset of likely relevant units terms from the [Units Ontology (UO)](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/UO).

## Funding and acknowledgements

Funding for the development of ESS-DIVE's Sample ID and metadata reporting format was provided by the US Deparment of Energy (DOE), Biological and Environmental Research Program, Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division, Data Management.

The updated sample reporting format for interdisciplinary ESS samples contains modifications and extensions of guidelines originally created by the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) and IGSN organization. Individuals within these organizations are responsible for creating IGSN identifiers and standard sample metadata templates. We especially thank Kerstin Lehnert, Jens Klump, Lesley Wyborn, and Sarah Ramdeen for their development and engagement work, and/or direct assistence with using IGSN. 

As outlined in the [sample metadata sources]((/terms/sampleMetadataSources.md) document, many recommended metadata additions to the IGSN guidelines/schema come from Darwin Core, and MIxS. 

ESS community scientists helped test use of IGSNs, and provided critical feedback - resulting in our final recommendations. These include individuals from eight ESS projects, including: 
- SLAC Subsurface Biogeochemical Research (SBR) Scientific Focus Area (SFA), National Accellerator Laboratory Groundwater Quality: Zach Perzan and Kristin Boye
- Lawrence Livermore National Lab SBR SFA, Subsurface Biogeochemistry of Actinides: Nancy Merino and Mavrik Zavarin
- Pacific Northwest National Lab SBR SFA, Worldwide Hydrobiogeochemistry Observation Network for Dynamic River Systems (WHONDRS): Amy Goldman and James Stegen
- Argonne National Lab SBR SFA, Argonne Wetland Hydrobiogeochemistry: Pamela Weisenhorn 
- Lawrence Berkeley National Lab SBR SFA, Watershed Function (2 sub-projects): Patrick Sorensen, Dana Chadwick, Zarine Kakalia, Eoin Brodie
