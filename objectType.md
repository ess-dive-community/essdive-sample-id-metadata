# ESS-DIVE Proposed Object Type Vocabulary

We have modified the original SESAR IGSN list of [object type terms](https://www.geosamples.org/help/vocabularies#object) for Environmental Systems Science (ESS) samples. Currently, **you must use SESAR terms** to register samples for IGSNs. Please provide feedback on any additional terms needed, modifications to definitions needed, or terms that should be removed.

:-----------------------|:--------------------|:-----
Core                    |Core                 |A long cylindrical sample, usually of soil or sediment (for Environmental System Science). 
Core Section            |Core Section         |Segments of a "core", which can be arbitrarily cut or cut to obtain specific depths.
Cuttings                |Cuttings             |Loose, coarse, unconsolidated material suspended in drilling fluid.
Dredge                  |Dredge               |A group of rocks collected by dragging a dredge along the seafloor.
Experimental Specimen   |Experimental Specimen|A synthetic or natural material used during an experiment.
Grab                    |Grab                 |A sample (sometimes mechanically collected) from a deposit or area, not intended to be representative of the deposit or area.
Material Sample         |Individual Sample    |A sample that is an individual unit of material, including soil or sediment samples, biological material, or a bottle of fluid. [A physical result of a sampling (or subsampling) event.](	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/MaterialSample)
Filtrate                |NA                   |A sample that has gone through a filtration process to separate solids from fluids (liquids or gases), using a filter medium through which only the fluid can pass. _Must be associated with a filter size._ 
Material Captured in Filter|NA                |A material sample captured in filter, for example from a water sample that was filtered. Must be associated with filter size field. _Material options include: "particulate matter" or "particulate matter: organic particulate matter" ._
Organism                |NA                   |[A whole specimen of a biological organism.](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Organism) 
Part of organism        |NA                   |A specimen of a portion of a biological organism (e.g. leaf, root, stem).
Collection of organisms |NA                   |[A material entity that consists of two or more organisms, viruses, or viroids.](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PCO_0000000)
Site                    |Site                 |A place where a sample is collected.
